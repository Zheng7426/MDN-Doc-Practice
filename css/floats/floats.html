    <h1>Simple Float Example</h1>
    <div class="wrapper">
        <div class="box">Float</div>
        <p class="special">When will the moon be full and bright?
    
            Raising my wineglass, I ask the blue sky.
            
            I know not what year it is tonight,
            
            In the far-away heaven palace.
            
            I wish to return home with fair wind,
            
            For fear I cannot bear the freezing cold,
            
            So high in the marble towers and jade houses.
            
            I dance with my lonely shadow wild,
            
            As if I were not in the human world.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The moon rounds the red cabinet,

            Peeps through the silk-pad windows,
            
            And shines upon the sleepless man.
            
            The moon should not suffer the hatred,
            
            Why is it always full when people partï¼Ÿ
            
            People may have sorrows or joys,
            
            And the moon may be dim or bright,
            
            This cannot be perfect since ancient time.
            
            I wish that we all would have a long life,
            
            Sharing the beautiful moon even miles apart.</p>
