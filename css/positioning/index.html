    <p>What the Great Learning teaches, 
    is to illustrate illustrious virtue; to renovate the people; 
    and to rest in the highest excellence. 
    The point where to rest being known, 
    the object of pursuit is then determined; and, that being determined, 
    a calm unperturbedness may be attained to. 
    To that calmness there will succeed a tranquil repose. 
    In that repose there may be careful deliberation, 
    and that deliberation will be followed by the attainment of the desired end. 
    Things have their root and their branches. 
    Affairs have their end and their beginning. 
    To know what is first and what is last will lead near to what is taught in the Great Learning.</p>
    <p>The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom, 
    first ordered well their own states. 
    Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. 
    Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons. 
    Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified their hearts. 
    Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. 
    Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. 
    Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things. 
    Things being investigated, knowledge became complete. 
    Their knowledge being complete, their thoughts were sincere. 
    Their thoughts being sincere, their hearts were then rectified. 
    Their hearts being rectified, their persons were cultivated. 
    Their persons being cultivated, their families were regulated. 
    Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. 
    Their states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and happy. 
    From the Son of Heaven down to the mass of the people, all must consider the cultivation of the person the root of everything besides. 
    It cannot be, when the root is neglected, that what should spring from it will be well ordered. 
    It never has been the case that what was of great importance has been slightly cared for, and, at the same time, 
    that what was of slight importance has been greatly cared for.</p>

        <p>What is meant by, "The cultivation of the person depends on rectifying the mind may be thus illustrated:-If a man be under the influence of passion he will be incorrect in his conduct. 
            He will be the same, if he is under the influence of terror, or under the influence of fond regard, or under that of sorrow and distress. 
            When the mind is not present, we look and do not see; we hear and do not understand; we eat and do not know the taste of what we eat. 
            This is what is meant by saying that the cultivation of the person depends on the rectifying of the mind.</p>
        <p>What is meant by "The regulation of one's family depends on the cultivation of his person is this:
        -men are partial where they feel affection and love; 
        partial where they despise and dislike; 
        partial where they stand in awe and reverence; 
        partial where they feel sorrow and compassion; 
        partial where they are arrogant and rude. 
        Thus it is that there are few men in the world who love and at the same time know the bad qualities of the object of their love, 
        or who hate and yet know the excellences of the object of their hatred. 
        Hence it is said, in the common adage,"A man does not know the wickedness of his son; 
        he does not know the richness of his growing corn." 
        This is what is meant by saying that if the person be not cultivated, 
        a man cannot regulate his family.</p>
