        <p>What is meant by, "The cultivation of the person depends on rectifying the mind may be thus illustrated:-If a man be under the influence of passion he will be incorrect in his conduct. 
            He will be the same, if he is under the influence of terror, or under the influence of fond regard, or under that of sorrow and distress. 
            When the mind is not present, we look and do not see; we hear and do not understand; we eat and do not know the taste of what we eat. 
            This is what is meant by saying that the cultivation of the person depends on the rectifying of the mind.</p>

        <p>What is meant by, "The cultivation of the person depends on rectifying the mind may be thus illustrated:-If a man be under the influence of passion he will be incorrect in his conduct. 
            He will be the same, if he is under the influence of terror, or under the influence of fond regard, or under that of sorrow and distress. 
            When the mind is not present, we look and do not see; we hear and do not understand; we eat and do not know the taste of what we eat. 
            This is what is meant by saying that the cultivation of the person depends on the rectifying of the mind.</p>
        <p>What is meant by "The regulation of one's family depends on the cultivation of his person is this:
        -men are partial where they feel affection and love; 
        partial where they despise and dislike; 
        partial where they stand in awe and reverence; 
        partial where they feel sorrow and compassion; 
        partial where they are arrogant and rude. 
        Thus it is that there are few men in the world who love and at the same time know the bad qualities of the object of their love, 
        or who hate and yet know the excellences of the object of their hatred. 
        Hence it is said, in the common adage,"A man does not know the wickedness of his son; 
        he does not know the richness of his growing corn." 
        This is what is meant by saying that if the person be not cultivated, 
        a man cannot regulate his family.</p>
